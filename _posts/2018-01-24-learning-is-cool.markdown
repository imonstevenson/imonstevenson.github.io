Learning is my favorite. For technical things, I prefer learning by reading on the web--it's fastest, cheapest, and most accessible. So I love a good article on <a href="https://hackernoon.com/" target="_blank">Hacker Noon</a> or <a href="https://dev.to" target="_blank">Dev.to</a>.

Here are some of favorite articles as of late accompanied by an appropriate GIF <i>(GHIF)</i> of my reaction to them:


## <a href="https://hackernoon.com/driverless-hotel-rooms-the-end-of-uber-airbnb-and-human-landlords-e39f92cf16e1" target="_blank">2025</a>
<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="5022417" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="2.1551724137931036"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/excited-babies-gif-5022417">Omg GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/excited-gifs">Excited GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

Wow. El futuro. What a concept. The author's opening anecdote was highly effective and such an attention grabber. The future? Driverless hotel rooms? My own personal gym on command? Count me in.

## <a href="https://hackernoon.com/username-or-password-is-incorrect-is-bullshit-89985ca2be48" target="_blank">Username OR Password</a>
<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="5898697" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.7913669064748199"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/clapping-gif-5898697">Ohhhhh Yes GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/clapping-gifs">Clapping GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

This is a 10/10 read, and is certainly something we *all* think. Username OR password?? Well which one! Because I have about two dozen different usernames to remember and fifty different passwords I'll need to cycle through.

## <a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/" target="_blank">git commit -m "?"</a>
<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="5822381" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.0"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/ilikethat-djkhaled-snapchat-khaled-likethat-gif-5822381">Ilikethat Djkhaled GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/ilikethat-gifs">Ilikethat GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

Oh the commit message--an hourly dilemma. To capitalize or not to capitalize? What tense should I be using? I reference this article often. Consistency, people.

## <a href="https://dev.to/__namc/eli5---map-filter-reduce-40p" target="_blank">MFR</a>
<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="7715402" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.5277777777777777"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/feel-me-think-about-it-gif-7715402">Feel Me GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/feel-gifs">Feel GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

For most of my coding life, OO was all I knew. I slept, ate, and breathed object orientation. \*Fast forward to CS 441: Programming Languages\* Excuse me, functional what? Higher order who? This is one of the first articles I read after being introduced to the topic and it cleared up a lot of confusion.

Also, TIL that Tenor is superior to Giphy.
