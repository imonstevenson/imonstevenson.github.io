It's been a while...oops. I truly intended to do better, but then I didn't. My fault. I've been up to neat things though! 

### Recap
May 2018: Graduated from UMKC with a BS in CS  
Two weeks later: Started at [Lockton](https://www.lockton.com/the-lockton-story) as a SharePoint Developer.  
Ever since then: Tried to adjust to life as an *adult*

So like I said, n-e-a-t. In other cool news, I decided to be that coding friend and work on my friend's app idea. I know, I know \*cue eyeroll\*
<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="4940860" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.9021739130434783"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/nene-eye-roll-nene-leakes-annoyed-gif-4940860">Nene Eye Roll GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/nene-gifs">Nene GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

But this one's cool (again, like I said) and it's going to help the world! It's called giving back. Not the app, the--never mind. Anyway, my friend is an internal medicine resident and he pitched me the idea by starting off with "So when people die..." Yikes. I'll give more detail on the app as I make progress. The repo is currently private on GitHub (my first every private repo, thanks [Microsoft](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/github-free-users-now-get-unlimited-private-repositories/)).

Til next time!
